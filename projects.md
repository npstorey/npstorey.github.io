## Civic infrastructure

*Reference datasets, standards, and governance infrastructure for NYC government.*

### NYC Agencies & Governance Organizations

The City's first standardized open dataset of NYC agencies. Combined 8 scattered internal lists into one public reference of 303 entities. Now powers the NYC.gov Agency Directory and serves as the go-to source for cross-agency data work.

### Day One for NYC

Independent guide to governing NYC from day one. Practical frameworks and institutional knowledge for incoming administrations and engaged residents.

### Fearless Cities Conference

Co-organizer and steering committee member for Fearless Cities North America - 500+ municipalist organizers, elected officials, and activists. Programmed panels, facilitated sessions on democratic innovation and participatory governance. Also organized a vermouth bar that turned into a hub for informal organizing.

### MetaCat

Internal metadata catalog containing 325+ data assets across 21 NYC agencies. Improves data discovery and governance across city operations.

*Internal tool; not publicly available.*

## Tools & prototypes

*AI tools, analysis pipelines, and internal platforms for city staff and residents.*

### Civic AI Tools

Collection of MCP servers and skills for working with civic data. Includes tools for NYC Open Data and US Census data - packaged together to make city datasets and census data accessible to AI systems.

### NYC Traffic Anomaly Detection

Proof-of-concept for automated anomaly detection in NYC traffic data. Built with Civic AI Tools to show how AI can find unexpected patterns in city datasets.

### Safe Haven Model of Practice Co-Creation

Designed and facilitated a vTaiwan-inspired policy co-creation process at NYC Department of Homeless Services (2018-2019). Used Polis and focused conversation methodology to engage 300+ frontline outreach and Safe Haven staff in drafting a Model of Practice policy document. Applied deliberative democracy tools to government policy development - bringing staff experience into the design rather than top-down mandates.
