I'm a data governance and digital services leader with over 10 years of experience in NYC government. I currently serve as Director of Data Governance at the NYC Office of Technology & Innovation, where I built the City's first standardized open dataset of NYC agencies and co-developed MetaCat, an internal metadata catalog serving 21 agencies.

Previously, I founded the Street Homeless Solutions Lab at DHS and led racial equity analysis that secured hundreds of additional supportive housing units for New Yorkers.
