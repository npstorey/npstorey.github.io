I work in New York City government on data governance and digital services. My work spans civic data infrastructure, digital tools and platforms, and experimental games and interfaces - how I learn new tools and prototype ideas.

I'm an urban planner by training, a civic technologist by practice, and a small-d democracy nerd at heart.
